I use a slightly recolored verison of the icon located [Here](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/super-mario-icons-by-ph03nyx/Retro-Mario-icon.html)

I would add the file here but you don't add a non text file to git hub as far as I'm aware.

You can really use whatever ico file you want if you complie the program yourself.
