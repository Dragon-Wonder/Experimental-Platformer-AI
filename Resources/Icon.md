I use the icon created by [Daniele De Santis] (http://www.iconarchive.com/artist/danieledesantis.html) that is located [Here](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/playstation-flat-icons-by-danieledesantis/playstation-circle-dark-icon.html) which is under the license [CC Attribution 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

I would add the file here but you can't add a non text file to git hub as far as I'm aware.

You can really use whatever ico file you want if you complie the program yourself, just put it in the resource folder called "Icon_App.ico" (If you are using my complie script).
