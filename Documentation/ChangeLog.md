## Old versions

```

## [4.0.0] - 2015-08-21

### Notes

* This version has a completely rewritten code; I'll to remember the major things that are different but I may have forgotten stuff.

* The main point of this rewrite was to improve the structure of the code so later changes are easier as opposed to adding a bunch of new features.

* This was one big pain of a rewrite but hopefully it'll make things easier to improve upon in the future.

### Removed

* Generate Random Number Function as it was quite useless

* Windows.h library requirement

* The increase chance of the player with the highest fitness being selected over the other players.

### Changed

* Spilt the program into a lot more .cpp to better organize everything

* Change complier from Cygwin to MinGW

* Changed the icon (same author just different coloring)

* Change log around so that the bullet points appear

* The Read Me so that it is not off putting to the people who find the code. As well as better explain it.

### Added

* Classes

* Tick with universal "sleep"

* More debug messages.

* More comments.

* Makefile for Linux builds.

* Compile.bat for MinGW Windows builds.

* Debug Folder with some debug scripts

* Documentation Folder for documentation

* Count down that will kill player when it reaches 0.

* Define of Best Players

* Naming Notation

* A short death animation

## [3.3.0] - 2015-08-05

### Added

* More comments to (hopefully) better explain stuff

### Changed

* The icon (like 3 times because I can't decide what I want)

* File version numbering changed slightly in boilerplate
	For File Version it goes [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH].[BUILD NUMBER]
	This is mostly just when I am working on the new RC. It won't be
	reflected in the Product Version which will still follow [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]

* Boilerplate.rc around to make changes to it easier to do.

* Easier to change log name

* Generation number added to log

* At the end of a generation a line is made in the log to help divide them easier

* Log name from "log.txt" to "player.log"
	This so that now that I have GitHub on my computer I can set it
	to ignore *.log rather than *.txt

* How "Mating" is done to make the New generation

### Fixed

* It just occurred to me that the program does not log the last player of a generation
	so I fixed that.



## [3.2.0] - 2015-08-04

### Changed

* Player gets fitness boost for killing a monster

* Monster from "O" to "+"

* Name from Mario to Platformer!
	(Please don't sue me Nintendo!)

### Added

* Coins (are "O")

* Score for player. Goes up after collecting coins, and killing monsters.
	Weighs into fitness (I did this because under hard mode these actions would not effect fitness)



## [3.1.0] - 2015-08-04

### Added

* Multiple jumps allowed; it is configurable

* Configurable Jump height

### Changed

* How player falling is handled.

* Config functions split into its own .cpp

* Changed Monster symbol from '?' to 'O'

### Fixed

* Bug where all fitnesses were displayed as 0 because I was
restarting the map before I recorded the fitness -_-



## [3.0.0] - 2015-08-04

### Changed

* Made several variable defined at the start of the code to make them easier to change.
	These include:
	* Map Height
	* Map Width
	* Max Player Steps (Cannot be greater than 65535)
	* Players per Generation (Cannot be less than 10)
	* Sleep Time

* Mario.h - a basic header to clean up the main code

* Base map moved to Mario.h



## [2.1.0] - 2015-08-03

### Added

* Program now checks version number written to config file with its own
	if the numbers do not match it will overwrite the old file with a new one
	this is to prevent program crashing bugs if I add something to a new config
	that isn't in the old one.

* Added Icon to complied application (will likely change later just testing what I can do.)

### Changed

* A player "jumping" on a monster will kill it.



## [2.0.0] - 2015-08-01

### Added

* "Hard Mode" in config

* With this enabled players die under more conditions

### Changed

* Fitness drop from frames increased.

* Code performance increased (removed unneeded for loops)

* Map up a bit to increase the chances of a player making it through

### Removed

* A lot of debugging lines I commented out



## [1.2.1] - 2015-08-01

### Fixed

* A misplaced check of if the map should be shown that crashed the program



## [1.2.0] - 2015-08-01 - [YANKED]

### Added

* Version Number added to Config file

### Fixed

* Monster movement is no longer randomly move.
	Hopefully to improve survivability between generations



## [1.1.2] - 2015-08-01 - [YANKED]

### Fixed

## [1.1.1] - 2015-08-01
