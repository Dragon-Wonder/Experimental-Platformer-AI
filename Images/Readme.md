# Images Folder

This folder holds that images that will be loaded by the program if show map is enabled.

Currently these are just placeholder images that will likely be replaced in a later version.

All the images are taken from different sources but are placed in a single image so that they are all be referenced together.

If you are not okay with us using your image for this project, and / or we are not adhering to the license under which your image was released, please let us know through an issue, or a message and we will work on fixing it as soon as possible.

All the images are png and 24px by 24px.
