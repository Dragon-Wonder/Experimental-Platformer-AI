Software Status can be the following:
|===================|========|====================================================|
| Status            | Short  | Description                                        |
|===================|========|====================================================|
| Release           | r      | The supported release of the program               |
|===================|========|====================================================|
| Release Candidate | rc     | The next likely release version;                   |
|					|	     | usually only a few bugs / todos separate this from |
|					|		 | a release. It is pretty safe to use.               |
|===================|========|====================================================|
| Beta				| b      | This version will compile and / or run but does not|
|                   |        | work as expected (or crashes often)                |
|===================|========|====================================================|
| Alpha				| a		 | This version does not work at all; it usually won't|
|                   |        | compile at all or crashes more times than it works |
|                   |        | best not to use versions in this state             |
