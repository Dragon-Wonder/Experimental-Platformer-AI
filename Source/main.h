These defines are for the size of the map. The default is 14 high by 217 width
You should note that if you change this you have to change the base map under map.h as well to the same
size or you will most likely run into a lot of issues. Later verisons where you can simply load your own map
will likely remove these and dynamically allocate the map size for you.
