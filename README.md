## Questions, patches, and other feedback

We are pretty novice programmers at best. Part of the reason we made this was to improve our skills. And part of the reason we made it open source is to get feedback.

We are always open to people contributing to the project by giving suggestions, or helping us with improvements. 

If you have any questions or a suggestions or improvement please feel free to leave it as an issue in [this tab] (https://github.com/GamerMan7799/Experimental-Platformer-AI/issues).

## Building the Project

### Windows

You can download the .exe under the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/GamerMan7799/Experimental-Platformer-AI/releases) you should just be able to run this as is (if 4.0.0+ older editions require extra files included in the download).

If you wish to complie it yourself you can use the Comple.bat file if you have MinGW on your computer or you can use the complie.sh in the Debug folder if you have Cygwin.

Any other complier you wish will work these are just the ones I've used and made script to help with the compling.
	
### Linux

You should be able to use the Makefile or the Complie.sh script to complie the program. You shouldn't need any other files.

### Macs

I don't know your on your own. Sorry.
