# Experimental-Mario-AI
So I am putting this here to share with a friend. It is a makeshift idea where an AI will attempt to teach itself how to play a really dumbbed down version of mario

Don't expect much in the way of me explaining things and do with this what you want I don't really care. That being said I would welcome suggestions to imporvements because I'm still pretty novice on C++.
